I used the 2015 build as it does not require Windows 10 to be install on the machine.

Install Visual Studios 2015 

Make sure that if it says you need .Net or any additional installs that you accept them during the Visual Studio install.
Any additional dependencies should not be required as they should be built into the framework.

Once Installed and opened click File>Open Project
Navigate to the solution on your local machine and open

The solution should open and the Test Explorer Visible on the left.
Right click on any of the test and either click run or debug

You can also use run all or run

You can also run the tests from the Test tool header.

************Test Explorer is not visible***********
Click Test>Windows>Test Explorer



******If References do not work correctly(I have seen this issue before)*******

In Project right click on References>Manage Nuget Packages
Search for Selenium.Webdriver and download Selenium Webdriver   
Search for Selenium.Support and download Selenium Support
Search for Selenium.Firefox.Webdriver and download Selenium Firefox Webdriver

*******Final Thoughts and Additions************

Add a log report that is generated after every run
Currently you can only see fail or succeed

Add ID tags into the code or classes to better hook into the text
